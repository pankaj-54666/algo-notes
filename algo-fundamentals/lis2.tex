\begin{problem}{Longest Increasing Subsequnce Solution Review}
    Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence. LC 300\\
    (a)Give $O(n^2)$ algorithm.\\
    (b)Give $O(n*log(n))$ algorithm.

\begin{solution}[Recursion Approach Analysis]

    \begin{lfigure}{resources/LIC_recursion_analysis.jpg}{0.6}{0.38}
        There exist 4 variation via which you could write solution for this.

        For all these 4, rec + iterative solution is possible for every one.

        \textbf{ending at idx with iteration, is most preferred in LIS type problem due to its nature}

        Listing all solution for refence, except patience sorting.

        \textbf{purpos is to understand code flow in total 8+1 ways we could have solved this issue.}

        \textbf{individual pattern is more suitable depending upon the problem type.}
