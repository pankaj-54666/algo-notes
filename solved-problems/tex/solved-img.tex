        There exist two solution for this problem.

        DP solution is a nice variatin of take/not-take dp. with \textbf{take} only applicable, if idx start at a time less than \textbf{end}

        Other solution is greedy, once we pick i, we have a set of j to pick from.
        there are a lot of edge cases in this.
